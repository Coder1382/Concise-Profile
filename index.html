    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <section>
      After graduation from Kazan Federal University as Geologist, I worked in that profession for a long time,
      including at a rotational basis at different sites.
      Meanwhile, I pondered on switching to the information tehcnology industry in view of its ever-increasing importancy.<br>
      Global changes that entailed a global crisis made it economically inexpedient to work at a rotational basis for that time.
      Therefore, I focused on frellancing as a translator from English to Russian and vice versa.
      Initially, that business was a reasonable choice in terms of earnings.<br>
      However, further changes in global circumstances entailed a steep drop in the demand on that language pair. 
      Therefore, I vigorously took on learning programming languages. I had been improving my skills by reading relevant books,
      watching relevant videos in the Inthernet, as well as by coding. 
      After a while, I decided to join a specialized education institution to increase my chances for get in the IT industry.<br>
      Thus, since October 2023, I am a student of School 21 driven by Sber. Upon having attained level 10, I decided to major in Java language.
      On the path to level 10, I had completed all necessary projects in C/C++, including games Teris and Snake with use of Qt library.<br>
      I have written a REST API app in Java for managing databases, a browser game in JavaScript, two Telegram bot in Python.
      Besides that, I have written several more projects in C/C++ and Java.

    In the <a href="https://github.com/Coder1382/Browser-Game">Browser Game</a>
    a triangle subject travels along the screen among square obstacles that move towards it.
    The control is performed via arrow keys Left/Right/Up/Down; to travel faster, tap a respective arrow key.
    In the game, there are three levels differing in the rate of appearance of obstacles. In the level 3, obstacles rotate.
    You can start playing by following <a href="coder1382.github.io/Browser-Game/">the link</a> file.
    The project is written in JavaScript, HTML. CSS.

    <a href="https://github.com/Coder1382/REST-API-Java-PostgreSQL-Gradle">REST API application (JDBC, PostgreSQL)</a>
    implements One-to-Many and Many-toMany relations, as well as processes requests as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>show all table records / one table record (GET request with/without parameter)</li>
    <li>add a table record (POST request)</li>
    <li>update a table record (PUT request)</li>
    <li>delete a table record (DELETE request)</li>
    </ul>
    There are three table at hand: Fruit, Sellers. Suppliers.
    A record in the Fruit table includes of two mandatory fields: Name and Price. Each record has a list of sellers.
    User can update the price, as well as add/remove sellers to/from the list.<br>
    A record in the Sellers table includes one mandatory field Name, and one optional field Supply.
    Each record has a list of fruit traded by a seller.
    User can change a supplier for a certain seller, as well as add/remove fruit to/from the list.<br>
    A record in the Suppliers table includes one mandatory field Name.
    Each record has a list of sellers served by such a supplier. User can add/remove sellers to/from the list.<br>
    Upon adding, editing, removal records in tables, lists associated with respective records get automatically updated/deleted.<br>

      The <a style="padding-top: 1vh;" href="https://github.com/Coder1382/TCP-Linux-socket">Linux Socket</a> project is
      a console application for establishing a TCP connection and data exchange between a server and clients.
      Message sent by a client via the console are dispalyed in the server's console.
      The server saves such an acquired message in a log-file, and echoes it to the client's console.<br>
      The server's console requires one input parameter: the port number. The client's console requires an input string comprising three parameter:
      the client name, port number, and the connection time in seconds.
      An example of making use of the project is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/Coder1382/REST-API-Java-PostgreSQL-Gradle/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>.
      The project is written in C++.
